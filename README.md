# Task-Group-Project

# What is this?
- This is a webpage developed by students attending the UofM Coding Bootcamp. This project is a display of our abilities to use all of the tools and technologies we have learned, along side of the JavaScript and JavaScript variants we have learned.

- This webpage allows you to search for various events across the world using the ticketmaster API. It is devised into three pages, with two of the pages being unique to its own category. It also includes a search using OPEN BREWERY DB API to allow you to search for a brewery in the region of your event so you may have a place to grab a drink and perhaps a bite to eat before your event. 

# Installation 
- There is no Installation required. You can use and view this application in your browser

# Usage 
- Once you have opened this page you should be on the homepage. From the homepage search for any event by keyword you may be searching for. If any events are available they will replace the placeholder widgets that are on the main page section. 

- If you wish to specifically search for a Concert or musical event you can navigate to the concert page using the navbar located at the top right region of the page. Once on the concerts page you can sort through events by musical genre and include a keyword in the search bar to find your event faster.

- Located on the homepage and concert page on the left hand side is a search bar and dropdown for a brewery search. Here you can either search by state and city or if you feel comfortable just search by city. A list of breweries will populate in groups of  three's where you can sort through them, click the link to visit the brewery website or click the address to get directions.

# Bugs 
- Some of the pages are still slightly buggy when resized for smaller devices. If you view this page on a cellular device, you may run into issues of items overlapping each other. With time I expect this bug to be fixed with small tweaks. Check this readme in the future if you wish to stay update about this fix. 

- The brewery API is no longer being updated so you may find that links to the breweries website are no longer active or that brewery may have changed locations. The owner of the API is creating a new version. When that version is released, this site will be updated with the newest information
